# Algorithms and Data Structures Project

This repository contains implementations for various algorithms and data structures developed as part of a university project for the Algorithms and Data Structures course. The project is divided into four main parts:

1. **Binary Insertion Sort Implementation:** 
   - Implementation of the binary insertion sort algorithm.

2. **Skiplist Implementation:** 
   - Implementation of the skiplist data structure.

3. **Priority Queue Implementation:** 
   - Implementation of the priority queue data structure.

4. **Graph Implementation and Prim's Algorithm:** 
   - Implementation of graph data structure and Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning tree.
